# React Filter Project
## Description
The React Filter Project is a learning project aimed at teaching developers how to make filters with React. The project fetches data from the TMDB API, which shows movies. The filters are created using the React useEffect and useState hooks, allowing users to filter movies by genre. Additionally, the project uses the Framer Motion library to create animations with the filters.
